This project investigates the neural decision-making processes in mice responding to visual stimuli. Using R, it integrates exploratory data analysis and machine learning models (logistic regression, LDA, and KNN) to classify feedback outcomes based on neural spike rates and stimulus characteristics. The study highlights the relationship between pulse rates, average spikes, and decision accuracy, contributing to neuroscience research on behavioral responses.
