 This project analyzes neural activity data from mice to predict decision-making outcomes based on visual stimuli. Utilizing R for data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and predictive modeling, the study employs techniques such as logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, and k-nearest neighbors to classify feedback types.
